CORS, or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, is a security measure in web browsers that controls
 how websites from one domain can request and use resources from another domain. This helps 
 prevent potential security risks.

How it Works:

By default, web browsers don't allow websites to make requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page.
Servers need to include special headers in their responses to allow cross-origin requests.
